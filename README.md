 🧠 AI-Powered Customer Churn Prediction System

📋 Overview
This project is an "AI-powered Churn Prediction" that identifies customers who are likely to leave a company’s service.  
By using "machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting this system helps businesses take proactive retention measures.

The web interface is built using "Streamlit", allowing users to input customer details and instantly view churn predictions.
